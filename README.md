# Trivia Game

This game is a educational project we've developed at Trybe. It's proposal is to make a questions and answers game, with a specific timer for the answers, calculating the player's score in case of a hit. It also gives the option of consulting the ranking of the players and also access to the settings to be able to customize the game. Since it was a group project, it was also possible to develop soft skills such as brainstorming, commits to multiple branches, parallel and pair/group programming.

<h2> About the project: </h2>
  
This project was developed in collaboration with [Carlos Daniel](https://github.com/carllosdannyel), [Gabriela](https://github.com/gahbimenezes), [Bruno](https://github.com/brunodnc) and [Daniel](https://github.com/DanielCavalcantih).
